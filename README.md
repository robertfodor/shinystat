# ShinyStat

This ShinyStat repository is a collection of the source code behind web applications designed to assist psychology students and researchers with conducting statistical reporting tasks such as descriptive statistics, linear modelling, and variance analysis. These apps aim to simplify the process of conducting statistical analyses and reporting their results, and provide an alternative to the overly complicated and mostly just annoying SPSS software.

## About the Apps

The ShinyStat web applications have been developed using R and the Shiny web application framework. They were designed to be user-friendly, intuitive. All you need to do is upload your data, and customize the settings as needed, and the analysis and plots will be generated for you.

Supported file types are:

- CSV with first row as column names,
- SPSS .sav files,
- and Jamovi .omv files.

## Getting Started

## Acknowledgments

I would like to give a nod to jamovi and SPSS, as I studied their outputs and used their software for testing data sets while creating these apps.

## Contact

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel open an issue.
